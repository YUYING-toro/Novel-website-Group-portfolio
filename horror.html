            <h1>This Is Not a Ghost Story</h1>
            <h2>Author:  Andrea Portes </h2>
            <p>The world we knew is gone. What world will rise in its place?</p>

            <p>The Twelve have been destroyed and the terrifying hundred-year reign of darkness that descended upon the
                world has ended. The survivors are stepping outside their walls, determined to build society anew—and
                daring to dream of a hopeful future.
            </p>
            <p>But far from them, in a dead metropolis, he waits: Zero. The First. Father of the Twelve. The anguish
                that shattered his human life haunts him, and the hatred spawned by his transformation burns bright. His
                fury will be quenched only when he destroys Amy—humanity’s only hope, the Girl from Nowhere who grew up
                to rise against him.</p>
            <p>One last time light and dark will clash, and at last Amy and her friends will know their fate. </p>
